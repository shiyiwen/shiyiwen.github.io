# Social Mixing and Respiratory Transmission in Schools [(SMART)](http://www.smart.pitt.edu/)

The project aims to precisely quantify the contact patterns of school-age children. Both ¡°diary-based¡± methods and cutting-edge electronic tools is used to better document the contacts and mixing patterns of school-age children whether they are in school, at home, or in the community. Using the partial and full network characteristics collected, we analyze the network structure and develop agent-based models of transmission. We will also use the empirical data to parameterize the agent-based modeling framework to simultaneously model contagion of disease and diffusion of information on the measured networks as well as interventions. The project is funded by CDC.

SMART deployed motes to students to collect their contact information. A mote is a small electronic device. They send out a weak signal and record the signal of other motes at the same time. Students wear the motes during a typical school day and all their interactions and durations are recorded by the motes.

Figure below shows some preliminary network analysis results. A weighted contact network was generated from the mote data of one participated elementary school.

Two types of simulation models are built using Repast S. One is based on the weighted contact graph that similar as above. Another model simulates students¡¯ activities and behaviors based on their real schedule and school spatial information. The simulation models are mainly designed to predict disease spreading in schools and evaluate the effectiveness of proposed intervention strategies.

Simulation samples (accelerated and unparameterized) are also available as animations to give you a general idea,

# Vaccine Modeling Initiative [(VMI)](https://vaccinemodeling.org/)

## Optimizing EPI vaccine delivery in developing countries

Mathematical model for typical WHO-EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) vaccine distribution networks was developed to analyze and optimize how vaccines flow down several levels of the supply chain from the manufacturers to the vaccine recipients. Several other issues of interest to public health administrator in developing countries can also be addressed, such as capacity allocation/expansion, the effect on the supply chain of introducing a new vaccine, and effect of changing the structure of the network and/or the distribution policies.This model has been successfully adapted for supply chains in three different countries. The proposed strategy results in a significant improvement of supply rate. 

## Optimizing the Choice of Vial Sizes for an Entire Regimen of Vaccines

The optimal vial size problem determines the best vaccine vial sizes to use to provide a vaccine regimen to maximize the vaccine supply, while minimizing the cost of administration. Linear programming models are formulated to address the problem of maximizing vaccine availability in multiple clinics of a reign by choosing the optimal vial sizes for groups of vaccines. A secondary objective is reducing costs of vaccines and storage. The solution also includes delivery pattern, as well as decision making for capacity expansion.

## Analyzing Cold Box Specifications in Niger

The project considers the problems of delivering vaccines effectively throughout Niger in cold boxes rather than using freezers or refrigerators. Quantitative methods were used to analyze impacts to vaccine coverage and wastage when using various cold box designs. Results indicate optimal vaccine administration policies for different situations and provide operational guidelines that can be easily implemented by clinicians in the field. 

## Vial Wastage Analysis 
Vaccine wastage is a significant problem especially at the clinic level when multi-dose vaccine vials are used.  Wastage rates vary across vial size, daily demands, administration frequency, planning horizon, order quantity and contamination. Several computational models and simulation models were developed to quantify the affection of those factors to vaccine wastage.
