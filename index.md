I am a secend year master student in Computer Science, University of Houston.

I will graduate in May 2016. I am looking for internship, and also a fulltime job as Software Developer/IT Consultant.

I was a .NET web developer at my previous position, working on an ASP.NET MVC 4 web application for an oil/natural gas software company. I also work with many of the latest web technologies such as HTML, CSS, jQuery to create a modern and easy to use web application.
